# 21-Days-SQL-Challenge
I’ve joined the 21-Days SQL Challenge organized by Indian Data Club  and sponsored by DPD Zero to strengthen my SQL skills step by step. This challenge helps me build a strong foundation in SQL through daily hands-on tasks, real-world problem-solving, and concept-based learning — from basic queries to advanced concepts.
